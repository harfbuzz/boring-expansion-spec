## 2023-11 (November 2023)

The proposal from September, revised after an informal _ad hoc_ committee meeting by telephone in Octoner 2023.
The main changes from the September draft are:
* Text for the main new or changed tables such as GLYF is copied from the existing text (such as for glyf) and updated; this adds substantially to the number of pages. Updated text is highlighted in yellow.
* The headers for GSUB, GPOS and GDEF are now minor revisions to the pre-existing headers, not entirely new versions, and are made compatible.
* Some more tables, notably sbix, have been handled.
* Sub-tables and new fields now have names like _dancingPaul2_ instead of _dancingPaul32_.
